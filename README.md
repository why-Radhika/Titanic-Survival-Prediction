# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival rate from the Titanic dataset using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a machine learning model to predict survival based on various features.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
1. Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Train a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict survival.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model.

## Running the Project in Google Colab

This project was created using Google Colab. To run it, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook on Google Colab:
   - Click [here to open the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b8lKvElfjIDj_JGIMASYKLQw5RPKZluj#scrollTo=y6Qu1t8CVF0o).
   
2. Download the Titanic dataset:
   - Download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file?resource=download) or upload it to your Colab environment manually.

3. Run the notebook:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook, from data loading to model evaluation.
